<p> I browsed through many lamp design options before deciding to create a lamp box. My base was 3D printed, while the 4 sides were created by laser cutting a wood panel.</p>

<p> <h4>Rhino steps</h4> <p>
        
<p> I created a cubical base shape & added a circle in the middle & 4 slots for the wooden panel.<p>

<p> <h4>3D Printing</h4> <p>

<p> My first 3D printing output had to be thrown away since the printer was not working properly. I changed the printer & was happy with the output.<p>

 Here's a picture of the final 3D printed output. Having the raft was very helpful & I ended up retaining it in my final lamp design.

<p> <h4>Laser printing</h4> <p>

<p> I used a wood panel with 2.5mm thickness for the laser printing. I created interwoven patterns so that the 4 sides would nest within each other. <p>

<p> I created 4 rectangular frames with different patterns.
