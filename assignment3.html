<p> I browsed through many lamp design options before deciding to create a lamp box. My base was 3D printed, while the 4 sides were created by laser cutting a wood panel.</p>

<p> <h4>Rhino & Grasshopper steps</h4> <p>
        
<p> I created a circular base shape & used rectangle components to create the slots.
I utilized the number slider for 4 parameters: 1) Radius of circle, x & y length of rectangle, & count of rectangles.<p>

<p> <h4>Circular components</h4> <p>

<p> I attempted creating a hexagon as one of the shapes, but in the ended went with 2 circular shapes, with different radius, & Y axis for the rectangle slots.

<p> <h4>3D Printing</h4> <p>

<p> My first 3D printing output had to be thrown away since the printer was not working properly. I changed the printer & was happy with the output.<p>

<p> <h4>Laser printing</h4> <p>

<p> I used two cardboards with varying thickness (3.5 & 3.2 mm) for the laser printing. I changed the slot dimensions accordingly. I tried speed of 50 and realized that it was not enought to cut the cardboard. I then tried speed of 20 which worked better.<p>


<p> <h4>Fabricated Outputs</h4> <p>
 
     <p> Images of the final fabricated output across both cardboard types. The image below is from the thicker cardboard (3.5mm)<p>

<p> It took a village to get this assignment done.<p> 
<p> Thank you to Tyson Zevenbergen & Christa Keizer - for showing me how the laser cutter works & helping resize the AI files to match the printer.<p>
