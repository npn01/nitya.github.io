I started out by reviewing a lot of Grasshopper tutorials. Some resources I found to be helpful include: 
<a href="https://thinkparametric.com/courses/grasshopper-101-introduction-to-parametric-modelling/lessons/10">ThinkParametric</a> & 
<a href="https://blog.ramboll.com/rcd/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-visual-scripting-with-grasshopper.html">Beginners Guide to Visual Scripting</a>
</p>

<p> Nadya's video tutorial was very helpful since the Rhino & Grasshopper learning curve was VERY steep.<p>

I created a circular base shape & used rectangle components to create the slots. 
I utilized the number slider for 4 parameters: 1) Radius of circle, x & y length of rectangle, & count of rectangles.
I attempted creating a hexagon as one of the shapes, but in the ended went with 2 circular shapes, with different radius, & Y axis for the rectangle slots.
