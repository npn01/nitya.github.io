            My process: Since I was traveling and only got back late last night, I ended up downloading a source file from the Instructables website (see attribution below).
            <br>
            My class-mate Tyson Zevenbergen offered to help me by printing out the file. He helped with the resizing of the AI file to match the cardboard thickness.<br>
            Christa Keizer helped me with the HTML code & showed me how to get the GitHub link to go live.<br>
