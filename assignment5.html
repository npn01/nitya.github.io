            <h3>For this assignment, decided to create a joint that would create a lock between 2 plates.</h3>

            </p>

<p> I browsed many CNC join designs, & found the V1 Engineering page linked above to be helpful. This page had a link to various design dxf & dwg files.</p>

<p> <h4>OnShape</h4> <p>
        
<p> I imported the dxf file to OnShape and extruded it to 25mm thickness.<p>

<p> <h4>Preparing file for Milling with KiCad & Bantam </h4> <p>
         
<p> I used method 2 suggested by Joshua and used KiCad to create .grb file to import to Bantam.</p>

     <p>
        <img src="kicada.jpg" width=400></a>
     </p>    

<p> I then imported the .grb file to Bantam and ran into issues, where the size of the canvas was smaller than the file.</p>

 <p> <img src="bantamfile.jpg" width=400></a> </p>  

<p> I tried changing the size of the canvas, but kept getting the same error -- "Toolpaths may cause collision with frame".</p>

 <p> <img src="bantam error.jpg" width=400></a> </p>  
<p> <img src="error.jpg" width=400></a> </p>  

<p> At this point I rant out of time & was unable to troubleshoot or do the milling in the lab.</p>

<p> <h4>Issues encountered & lessons learnt</h4> <p>
   
<p> I was unable to scale the object/image/sketch across OnShape, KiCad or Bantam and wondered if this was even possible. Another issue was the toolpaths were causing collision which I didn't know how to troubleshoot.<p>   
    

<p> <h4>Peer Attributions</h4> <p>
    
<p> Thank you V1 engineering for the design inspiration & sharing the 3D files freely for others to use.<p>    
<p> Thank you Joshua for showing us ways to prep the file for milling. <p>
