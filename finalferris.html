<h4>Design Inspiration Source</h4>

<p> I got the design inspiration & original STL files from Thingiverse. Yayy for Commons Attribution! <p>

<p> <h4>Project Steps</h4> <p>
        
<p> <h5> Step 1: Wheel <h5> <p> 
<p> I modified the STL file for the wheel & prepared the file before 3D printing it.<p>
	
<p><img src="wheeldremel.jpg" width=400></a></p>	

<p> The wheel took nearly 2 hours to print, even though Dremel machine estimated it would take 1 hour 22 mins.<p>

<br>
<br>

<p> <h5> Step 2: Stand <h5> <p> 
<p> Like the wheel, I modified the STL file for the stand & prepared the file before 3D printing it.<p>
<p><img src="standdremel.jpg" width=400></a></p>	
<p> The stand took about an hour to 3D print.<p>

<p><img src="stand3D2.jpg" width=400></a></p>	

<p> <h4> 3D Printer Settings <h4> <p> 
<p> I used the same 3D printer settings for both the wheel & stand.<p>
<p><img src="3Dprinter.jpg" width=400></a></p>	

<br>
<br>

<p> <h5> Step 3: Hanging parts <h5> <p> 
<p> My original plan was to create molds, but I was concerned about the weight of plaster molds since it would topple the 3D printed wheel & stand, so I decided to laser cut the hanging parts.<p>
<p> As mentioned in my presentation video, I used wood available at the Mill and noticed that it was catching fire very easily.<p>
<p> One of the Mill student assistants suggested changing the printer settings, since the quality of wood was poor.<p>
<p> I didn't have time to re-do another round of laser-cutting with new wood since both the laser-cutters were getting reserved to run a laser-cutting demo/class.<p>
	
<p><img src="lasercutsettings.jpg" width=400></a></p>	
<p> I don't have a picture of the individual laser cut pieces because I was focused on making sure the wood & machine didn't catch fire!<p>

<p> <h5> Step 4: Base mold <h5> <p> 
<p> My original plan did not include this, but I decided to include it so the wheel & base were more stable. <p>
<p> Instead of creating a new mold & cast, I decided to reuse the triangle mold from my previous assignment - Assignment 6.<p>
<p> This worked out well since I already had some left-over plaster from my previous project. <p>

<p> <h5> Step 5: Final Assembly <h5> <p> 
<p> Once I had all the parts, the assemly did not take time. <p>

<p> <h4>Bill of Materials - Actual cost</h4> <p>

<p> Filament to 3D print: $15 <p>
<p>I purchased the last filament from the Mill & ended up splitting it with another student, so I paid $15 for it<p>
	
<p> 3mm cardboard: 12x12 inches: $0 <p>
<p>Since I ended up using existing wood board from the Mill to laser cut the hanging parts, I did not have to pay for it. However, looking back I would have bought new wood panel if I had the time to redo the laser print.<p>
	
<p> Plaster: $5 <p>
<p>Since I had purchased it for previous project, I didn't have to incur any additional cost.<p>
	
<p> <h3>Total Cost:<h3> $20 <p>
